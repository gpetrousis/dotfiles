## Instalation

### Clone the repo
`git clone git@github.com:gpetrousis/dotfiles.git`

### Run the install script
`./install.sh`

The install script will create a symbolic link for each of these file into your home folder.
In case there is already an existing link it will be deleted and if there is already a config file it will be kept as backup in the format of `<filename>.<date>.backup`
